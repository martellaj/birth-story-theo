                    This is the account of Theodore Joseph Martella's birth
                    story as experienced and remembered by his dad. The events
                    in this story take place over about 50 hours between
                    Saturday August 24, 2019 at 2a and Sunday August 25, 2019 at
                    10:06p. This account was written 9 days postpartum after the
                    initial shock and awe has settled a bit, using notes and
                    pictures that were collected over that weekend.

                "Joe? I think I'm having contractions." Shannon woke me up
                around 2a Saturday morning with this. Was it the membrane sweep
                from the day prior? Or maybe the labor/birthday chocolate cake
                from Thursday night? We'll never truly know what was
                responsible, but things were moving. Contractions were about 5
                minutes apart at this point. Whatever the doctor has been
                telling us in recent weeks went out the window and I thought of
                when Pam was having contractions in the office and Jim was
                freaking out that it was go time. So we call the hospital and
                let them know that this baby was making his way out! They told
                us to stay home. They wanted the contractions closer together
                (3-4 minutes) and more consistently (1-2 hours straight). They
                told us to stay home as long as we can and to come in when the
                pain is just too much. So we stayed home.
            </p>

            <p>
                The good part about waking up this early and being told to stay
                home is that Premier League is on and Chelsea had the early
                game. I think it was the first time I got up for a 4:30a game
                before and Chelsea won 3-2 (#KTBBFH)!
            </p>

            <p>
                Shannon continued to labor until about 7a where we made the call
                to go in. Things were progressing and she was really feeling it.
                That was the first trip to triage. Long story short, we heard
                "You're (still) at 3 centimeters." a few more times that day. We
                also had 1 fun trip where they suggested we walk around for an
                hour to see if that could help progress things. Surprisingly,
                walking the grounds of a hospital for an hour with your 39w6d
                pregnant wife isn't the most fun thing in the world. Let's
                fast-forward to that night after a couple more trips to the
                hospital. During the last trip of the night, Shannon was given
                some morphine pills so she could go home and actually get some
                sleep. She was already exhausted from consistent labor (and back
                labor at that) for almost 24 hours at this point. After a quick
                stop to Chick-fil-a, the morphine did its thing and Shannon
                could rest.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hello, 2a again! The morphine worked for 2-3 hours, but the
                contractions persisted and they had gotten worse. Shannon's pain
                level of "6" saw new heights each visit to the hospital. We
                really didn't want to go back to the hospital until it was
                really time. Shannon fought the urge, and we didn't go back in
                until around 6a or so. "Still 3 centimeters." I thought baby was
                just going to be content staying in there forever. We went back
                home (for the last time for a few days!) to find Shannon's
                parents (who live 3 hours away) arrive to our house with lunch a
                couple hours later. They were antsy and couldn't stay away.
                After a few spoonfuls of soup, noticing that Shannon was really
                struggling with some hard contractions, I made the decision to
                go back to the hospital. These contractions were definitely
                different.
            </p>

            <p>
                We went in cautiously - both of us expecting to be turned away
                yet again - but were actually admitted before triage could even
                check her. Shannon's water broke before she could get strapped
                back into a triage bed (did find she was 6 centimeters dilated
                at this point)! Vitals were taken, Shannon was prepped, and the
                anesthesiologist was there within the hour to deliver the
                epidural. Finally - about 36 hours after the first contraction -
                Shannon felt some true relief and could rest. And so did I. Nap
                time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Things didn't move fast from there. At about 4p, and some
                Pitocin already kicking, there wasn't any additional progress
                made. Since her water broke 4 hours earlier, the team was a
                little concerned. They brought in the on-call doctor who took a
                peak and said, "Huh. I think your fore-bag may be intact still."
                What's a fore-bag? Some quick Googling tells me that a woman's
                water bag is actually made up of 2 water bags that usually fuse
                together by the end of a pregnancy. Usually. So with the least
                medical looking instrument I've ever seen (I was tired, but it
                legitimately looked like a ruler) the fore-bag was broken at
                around 5p. "Let's check you again in 2 hours."
            </p>

            <p>
                7p (2 hours later). "You're 10 centimeters dilated and 100%
                effaced. Time to go!" Good call on the fore-bag, doc. For the
                next 2 hours I watched my exhausted wife push with all her heart
                and all her strength to deliver our baby boy into the world. I
                was more involved than I thought I was going to be (snaps for me
                for not passing out) and I'm glad I was. I had the priviledge of
                witnessing the woman I love work harder than I've ever seen
                anyone ever work before. I truly fell in love with her all over
                again. However, it just wasn't meant to be. The doctor told us
                that things just weren't progressing and that it just didn't
                seem like it was going to. She suggested a C-section and Shannon
                couldn't have agreed faster. She was spent. At 9:40p, the
                pushing stopped and the surgical prep quickly began!
            </p>

            <p>
                They put Shannon on a stretcher and down the hall we went. I was
                freaking out more than her. The nurses and doctors brought her
                into the operating room. One nurse stayed behind with me, gave
                me all the gear I needed to put on over my clothes (shoe covers,
                fully body suit, face mask, hairnet), and then went inside
                telling me she'd be back for me when they were ready. A few
                minutes went by as I nervously paced in the hallway with tears
                welling in my eyes. I was nervous for Shan. I was nervous for
                baby. And I was a little nervous for myself. They called me in
                and pointed me at a stool right next to Shannon's head.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I walked into the room - tears still forming - my beautiful
                wife, who was calm from the increased drugs that were delivered
                via her epidural, sees me crying and with a goofy smile on her
                face said "Why ya crying, bud?". I laughed out loud and counted
                my blessings that I have such a strong partner by my side. I
                took my seat next to her and quickly checked around myself to
                make sure there was nothing I'd smack my head into too hard if I
                passed out. Then it started. I held her hand and told her how
                strong she was and how thankful I was for everything she put
                herself through to bring this baby into our lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                The doctor lowered the curtain that separated us just a bit. I
                watched through the plastic wall as my son was safely removed
                from his mother. I cried. I smiled. I cried more. There he was
                (without a name yet and one that wouldn't be picked until the
                next day) at 7 pounds on the dot and 19.75 inches long who came
                exactly on his due date - our baby boy who we tried for over a
                year for. He finally made it and he was perfect.
